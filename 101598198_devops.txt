DevOps is a combination of “Development” and “Operations.” It is a set of practices that brings together software development and IT operations teams to improve collaboration, speed, and efficiency in delivering applications and services.
The main purpose of DevOps is to lessen the software development lifecycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently. It aims to improve the quality and reliability of software through continuous integration and delivery.
