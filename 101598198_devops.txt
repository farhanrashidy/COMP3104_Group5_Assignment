DevOps is a combination of “Development” and “Operations.” It is a set of practices that brings together software development and IT operations teams to improve collaboration, speed, and efficiency in delivering applications and services.
The main purpose of DevOps is to lessen the software development lifecycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently. It aims to improve the quality and reliability of software through continuous integration and delivery.
DevOps is built on principles like automation, collaboration, continuous improvement, and rapid feedback. These principles help teams work more effectively together and deliver better software faster.
A strong DevOps culture encourages communication and shared responsibility between developers, testers, and operations. This breaks down silos and ensures everyone works toward the same goal — delivering high-quality software.
Automation plays a major role in DevOps. By automating testing, deployment, monitoring, and infrastructure management, teams can reduce errors, save time, and increase reliability.
Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of automatically building and testing code changes. Continuous Delivery (CD) ensures that the application can be deployed to production at any time. Together, CI/CD allows faster and safer software releases.
Common DevOps tools include version control systems, CI/CD pipelines, containerization platforms, and monitoring tools. Popular examples are Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible.
